# Design for What's The Move Harvard: A Breakdown of Choices

Welcome to WTM Harvard! Our website is made by students for students to find all of the best parties and social events going on at Harvard and the greater Cambridge-Allston area. Designed with your ease in mind, WTM Harvard is easy to navigate and interact with. Additionally, it is meant to be another social platform for Harvard students, where we can all keep each other in the loop and outside of our studies now and then. Below is each design feature of WTM Harvard's website, as well as the thought process that went behind implementing each.

A “design document” for your project in the form of a Markdown file called DESIGN.md that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least several paragraphs in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user’s manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the staff a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.
